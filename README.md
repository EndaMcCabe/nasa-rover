<h1>Overview of Project</h1>
'Mars Rover' is a site that is aimed towards landing of the Mars Rover on mars and general facts about NASA. The target audience for this website would be for young adults interested in the world of science from the hype that was created from Space X and Elon Musk.

<h1>User Experience</h1>
Mars Rover was designed to be a simple website to navigate simply with having a focus on easy to read facts in a seamless design.

<h1>Colour Scheme</h1>
<img src="images/CPallete.png">

For the colour scheme I went to <a href="https://mycolor.space/">https://mycolor.space/</a> in preparation of this project.

A black theme was chosen for this website as I believed it would suit the theme of NASA and space. Then I chose the Twisted Spot Palette as the generated gradient to made by the mycolor.

I decided for a simple use of #00C9C8 as the background color for the footer in this project. For the anchor links I used #47817F as I believe it had a nice look on the eyes when moving to different webpages. I decided against using #BFFCF9 as the main text color and stayed with using white instead as it seemed to take away from the feel of the website.
